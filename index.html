          <p> Hello, my name is Katie Himes. This will be my George Mason University practice website. I am a senior here at GMU, and this is the first time I have ever done any type of coding.</p>
   <p> I am a history major, and have a passion for teaching. My goal with this practice website is to learn something new, and create a website of nice quality. I have an extensive background in education, and have worked with kids since I was 19 years old.
   I have worked in the education field for the past 3 and a half years. It is my dream to one day teach english as a second language. I have a passion for accessability advocacy, and strive to help educate people.</p>
